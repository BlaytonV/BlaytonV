<h1>Hi, I'm Blayton!</h1>

I'm an aspiring **Software Engineer** with a strong interest in backend systems and microservices. I'm most comfortable coding in **Java** and **Python**, but I also have experience with **C++** and other foundational programming languages.

I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and building projects that have real-world impact. I'm currently expanding my skills in full-stack development and working on RESTful services.
